[Here is a draft flowchart](https://canvas.csuchico.edu/courses/39159/files/7176089?wrap=1) for your Program 4 implementation reference and [my brief video explanation](https://youtu.be/SUrkCC-kFh8). [Here](https://youtu.be/NLwdgTG76CU) is a video explaining how to setup a local testing environment using the provided peer executable.
