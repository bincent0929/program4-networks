    Executable Peer (to work with your own Registry you might need to chmod 0744).

You may want to first study how to use select() in your server (registry). Please check out the 30-min video and sample code under ["Week 12: select() and blocking functions" in Module 1: Theory of Computer Networks](https://canvas.csuchico.edu/courses/39159/pages/week-11-transport-layer-protocol-tcp-select-and-blocking-functions?module_item_id=2233383).

[Here is a draft flowchart](https://canvas.csuchico.edu/courses/39159/files/7176089?wrap=1) for your Program 4 implementation reference and [my brief video explanation](https://youtu.be/SUrkCC-kFh8). [Here](https://youtu.be/NLwdgTG76CU) is a video explaining how to setup a local testing environment using the provided peer executable.
